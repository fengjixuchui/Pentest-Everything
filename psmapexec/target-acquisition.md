# Target Acquisition

Target acquisition through PsMapExec is utilized through ADSI Searcher. As long as you are operating from a domain joined system as a domain user account, no issues should be encountered when acquiring targets.

By default only enabled Active Directory computer accounts are populated into the target list.

IP Address specification and targets from file are currently unsupported but in development.

### Syntax

```
PsMapExec -Targets [Targets]
```

The following parameters are supported for `-Targets`&#x20;

```powershell
# Grabs all workstations, servers and domain controllers within the domain
PsMapExec -Targets All

# Grabs only servers from the domain (Excludes DCs)
PsMapExec -Targets Servers

# Grabs only Domain Controllers from the domain
PsMapExec -Targets DCs

# Grabs only workstations from the domain
PsMapExec -Targets Workstations

# Set the target values to a defined computer name
PsMapExec -Targets DC01.Security.local
```
