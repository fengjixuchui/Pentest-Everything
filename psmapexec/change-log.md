# Change Log

## v.0.4.0 - 27-10-2023

* RDP module updated. Updated and improved SharpRDP binary submitted by [https://github.com/hosakauk](https://github.com/hosakauk). Binary now only performs and validates connection requests. Code should be about 10x faster than previous versions
* Updated the way PsMapExec handles threading for RDP.&#x20;
* Cleaned up various small bits and added some error checking.

## v.0.3.8 - 10-10-2023

* Added the method VNC. Can be used to check hosts that have "No Auth" set.&#x20;
* Updated code for parsing eKeys and LogonPasswords. This should now be much cleaner and parse useful information with a higher degree of accuracy

## v.0.3.5 - 4-10-2023

* Small update to address an issue with tickets clearing for the logon session when using Spray or GenRelayList, and the method terminates early.

## v.0.3.4 - 4-10-2023



* SMB Protocol: Optimized some parts of the method, this should now return results much faster.
* eKeys: Parsing for eKeys has been updated. This will now display each username as DOMAIN\USERNAME format. Tags have also been updated to notify when an account with AdminCount=1 has been identified and if an account with an Empty Password has been found.
* Consistent logic for each method has been written when retreiving results from a remote system.
* Updated the files module to correctly work over WinRM and SMB.
* Refactored the SessionHunter method to now only display computers for which we have administrative access to, and for where there is an administrative user session active on the system (Administrative users credentials are likely in memory)

## v.0.3.2 - 25-09-2023

* New Method: PsExec has been removed and replaced with Leo4j's Invoke-SMBRemoting. Use `-Method SMB` to initialise.
* GenRelayList: Resolved an issue with this method which was reporting incorrect SMB signing status on some hosts.
* Code Cleanup: More parts of the code have been generally cleaned up.

## v.0.3.0 - 22-09-2023

* More speed: We are now using runspaces for WinRM and WMI. Things should be a lot quicker for these two methods now. We also have some additional filtering when port scanning. This should should strip out non-candidate systems even better.&#x20;
* Syntax change: To use SessionHunter,GenRelayList and Spray we now see this as a parameter for `-Method` for example: `PsMapExec -Targets All -Method GenRelayList` . This is to ensure more consistency across syntax.
* Code Cleanup: Various bits of code throughout has been cleaned up and generally just made more efficient. There is a lot more work in this regard to complete however.
