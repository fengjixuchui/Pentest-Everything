## V.0.3.0 - 22-09-2023

* More speed: We are now using runspaces for WinRM and WMI. Things should be a lot quicker for these two methods now. We also have some additional filtering when port scanning. This should should strip out non-candidate systems even better.&#x20;
* Syntax change: To use SessionHunter,GenRelayList and Spray we now see this as a parameter for `-Method` for example: `PsMapExec -Targets All -Method GenRelayList` . This is to ensure more consistency across syntax.
* Code Cleanup: Various bits of code throughout has been cleaned up and generally just made more efficient. There is a lot more work in this regard to complete however.
