# Using Credentials

Most methods within PsMapExec supports using various credential material.&#x20;

### CurrentUser

This switch allows for the current user context to be used across authentication. You dont really need to specify it as PsMapExec will enable this switch if no impersonation is required.&#x20;

```powershell
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WMI -CurrentUser -Command ps
```

### Ticket

A base64 encoded Kerberos ticket can be supplied to the `-Ticket` parameter either directly into the console or can be loaded from file.

the username switch does not need to be provided as a valid kerberos ticket will contain the intended username for the ticket anyway.

```powershell
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WMI -Ticket "doIhsj..."
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WinRM -Ticket "C:\ticket.txt"
```

### Username and Hash

A username and hash combination can also be provided for authentication. The following hashes are currently accepted:

* RC4 / NT - 32 character hash
* AES256 HMAC - 64 character hash

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WMI  -Command "net user" -Username [User] -Hash [Hash]
```
{% endcode %}

### Username and Password

Of course a tradational username and password combination is also supported. If the provided password contains a "$" ensure the password is wrapped in single quotes.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WinRM -Username [User] -Password [Password]
```
{% endcode %}

### Local Authentication

Currently, the switch `-LocalAuth` is only supported across the following methods:

* WMI
* MSSQL (MSSQL SQL Server authentication)

Local authentication currently only supports a username and password combination.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
# WMI
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method WMI -LocalAuth -Username [User] -Password [Password]

# MSSQL
PsMapExec -Targets All -Method MSSQL -LocalAuth -Username sa -Password sa
```
{% endcode %}
